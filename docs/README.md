## Concepts

A report is a generated markdown file (and soon might be html or json).  A report has many sections.  A section and it's data is generated by crawling issues from a project board's cards or a repositories issues (known as targets).  For that reason, there are "project" reports and "repo" reports.  A project report for example expects data from a project board (and it's stages).

Project board reports report on the life cycle of work (a card) as it moves through `stages`.  The logical stages are pre-defined for consistent reports.

```
    Proposed => Accepted => In-Progress => Done
``` 

Note: "In progress" (default in GitHub Kanban project) is auto mapped to In-Progress.

Each stage can map to one or more physical columns on your board.  The time for each stage is recorded as the first time it entered that stage from a previous stage or no stage.  For example, if it moved from accepted to in progress on date 1, then to Done on date 2 and back to in progress on date 3, it has been in progress since date 1.

If a report section targets multiple targets, the data will be rolled up and passed to the report.  Since the stages and times are normalized, it can provide a common view of different boards and repos.

So let's get started ...

## Create a repo for running and storing your reports

This could be an existing repo but having a separate repo for the reports is preferred.  This also allows for securing reports.  The wider the scope, the better the ability to rollup data, share the cache and avoid rate limiting.  Note that the crawler writes a cache of etags so only data that changes between runs is pulled and debited to your rate limits.

## Create a token for accessing 

Create a personal access token that can read repo and project scopes for an identity that has permissions to the projects and repositories you are reporting on.

Add the secret to your repo and give it a name like `PROJECT_TOKEN`.  Documentation is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).

## Using in a workflow

Add the `project-reports-action` after the `'checkout` step.  Specify the secret name in the `token` input and supply a path relative to the root of the repo with your configuration file.

```yaml
jobs:
  run-reports:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: bryanmacfarlane/project-reports-action@v1-alpha3
        with: 
          token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          configPath: yourconfig.yml
```

You will want to checkin the reports after they are generated.  Note that the etag cache and other data files should be checked in with the reports.  Do this by checking in the `_reports` folder generated in the root of the repo.

Add this step after the `project-reports-action` step.  Note that pull-requests validate the report generation run but do not checkin reports or the cache.  Only pushes to master.

TODO: probably want to change this to !== pull_request since we will want to run on a schedule.

```yaml
    steps:
...
      - if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
        run: |
          git config user.name github-actions
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com     
          git add ./_reports
          git pull origin master
          git commit -a -m "adding reports"
          git push origin master
```

## Minimal Configuration File for Project

If you follow all the defaults, then a configuration file can be minimal. The [sample-reports repository](https://github.com/bryanmacfarlane/sample-reports) is an example of this.

**Type labels:** `epic`, `feature`, `task`, `bug`  
**Status labels:** `green`, `yellow`, `red`  
**Project board column names:** `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `In-Progress`, `Done`  

For issue "updates" head with `## update` (last updated column will read)  

This is the minimal configuration file for a project:

```yaml
targets: 
  todoProject:
    type: project
    htmlUrl: https://github.com/users/bryanmacfarlane/projects/2

reports:
  - name: Sample
    title: "My Project Report"
    targets: ['todoProject']
    sections:
      - name: "project-limits"
      - name: "project-in-progress"
      - name: "project-done"
      - name: "project-new"
```
